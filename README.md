# <codeQuiz>

## Description

This website was made to push the limits of my java skill and create a quiz that would automatically scroll through questions and save scores. I built this website do demonstrate my skills as a JavaScript developer.

## Usage

The website allows users to start a quiz on basic coding questions. When the user starts a timer will begin. When the user answers a question the next question will auto-populate and if the answer given was wrong then time will be removed. When the user answers the last question the timer will stop and the user will be prompted to enter their initials. When the user submits their initials their score (time remaining) will be saved to local storage and displayed. The user can then click the restart button the try again and compare their scores from past attempts. The View Highscores link in the header will toggle the highscore list on and off.

## Credits

I realize this is unprofessional, but this is school work and I did bang my head against the wall for hours doing this project so please allow me this funny response to credits. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Szj21arytU&ab_channel=vinting
